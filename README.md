# Southampton_course_projects
While preparing my application, I organized all the course projects I completed over the past few years. 
I see this not only as a way to preserve memories, but also as a demonstration of the effort and growth I have achieved during my studies.

I know this documentation isnâ€™t complete â€” I deleted a lot of files back then to save storage space ðŸ˜…. And honestly, Iâ€™m sure many of my juniors will surpass my scores.
But if you're curious, feel free to reach out. I can put together a separate folder to share whatever I still have from my coursework.

Lastly, Iâ€™d like to thank my friend Zhou for sharing the Ship Design and Economics module with me after I had accidentally deleted it, which made it possible to complete the collection of all my coursework from the second and third years.
