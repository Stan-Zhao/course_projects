# Southampton_course_projects
While preparing my application, I organized all the course projects I completed over the past few years. 
I see this not only as a way to preserve memories, but also as a demonstration of the effort and growth I have achieved during my studies.

I know this documentation isn’t complete — I deleted a lot of files back then to save storage space 😅. And honestly, I’m sure many of my juniors will surpass my scores.
But if you're curious, feel free to reach out. I can put together a separate folder to share whatever I still have from my coursework.
